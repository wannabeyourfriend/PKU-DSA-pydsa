  - `pythonds/basic/graph.py` – Graph representation with vertices.
  
- **Heaps and Priority Queues:**
  - `pythonds/basic/binheap.py` – Binary Heap implementation with additional methods like `top_k_heap`.

- **Lists and Linked Lists:**
  - `pythonds/basic/node.py` – Node class for linked lists.
  - `pythonds/basic/orderedlist.py` – Ordered (sorted) linked list.
  - `pythonds/basic/unorderedlist.py` – Unordered linked list.

- **Stacks, Queues, and Deques:**
  - `pythonds/basic/stack.py` – Stack (LIFO) ADT.
  - `pythonds/basic/queue.py` – Queue (FIFO) ADT.
  - `pythonds/basic/deque.py` – Double-ended Queue (Deque) ADT.

The `src` directory demonstrates usage of these data structures and implements various algorithms and problem-solving exercises. Examples include:

- **String and Recursive Problems:**
  - `src/203.py` – Anagram detection using multiple methods.

  - `src/304.py` – Number base conversion (decimal to binary, hexadecimal, etc.).
  - `src/305.py` – Infix to postfix expression conversion.

- **Queue and Printer Simulations:**
  - `src/309.py` – The hot potato game simulated with a queue.
  - `src/311.py` – Printer simulation using queues and tasks.

- **Dynamic Programming and Recursive Algorithms:**
  - `src/410.py` – Recursive and memoized solutions for the coin change problem.
  - `src/411.py` – Dynamic programming (DP) approach to the coin change problem.
  - `src/412.py` – 0/1 Knapsack problem using both DP and recursive solutions.

- **Searching and Sorting:**
  - `src/501.py` & `src/502.py` – Sequential and binary search implementations.
